[CAMA: Enhancing Multimodal In-Context Learning with Context-Aware
Modulated Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17097)

**Yanshu Li**, Jianjiang Yang, Ziteng Yang, Bozheng Li, Hongyang He, Zhengtao Yao, Ligong Han, Yingjie Victor Chen, Songlin Fei, Dongfang Liu, Ruixiang Tang
- We propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a training-free method that dynamically adjusts attention logits to fix attention deficits in LVLMs' multimodal in-context learning. This work improves model stability, reduces erroneous attention patterns, and enhances the consistency of multimodal reasoning.

[CATP: Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning for Efficient and Enhanced
Multimodal In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07871)

**Yanshu Li***, Jianjiang Yang*, Zhennan Shen, Ligong Han, Haoyan Xu, Ruixiang Tang
- We propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning (CATP), a training-free image token pruning method that adapts to complex image-text interactions and significantly reduces redundant image tokens in LVLMs. This research pushes forward the efficiency and practical applicability of multimodal in-context learning.
